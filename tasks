- open xml file
- modify xml file
- save xml file back

- polish typography, very basic version

- open en, zh two xml files at the same time
- horizontally (maybe you want vertically first?) show two views
- could save zh xml

- synchronized scroll document views

- drag & drop files in handling

- support vertical views
- support horizontal 3 views on big screen

- highlight the modifying view (based on git diff?)

- a more focused fullscreen mode

- autosave (should be easy)

- undo/redo (maybe cheap)
